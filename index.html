    <h1>Casey Transparency - Files For Download</h1>

    <p>
      Hello. This site exists because the Facebook page for <i>City of Casey 
      Transparency Advocate</i> doesn't allow file uploads.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I'm linking the files here for you to download.
    </p>

    <h2>Accounts I've blocked</h2> 

    <i>Last updated: Thursday Oct 24, 09:30 am</i>
    
    <p>
      I'm not in favour of blocking people who engage in good faith, no matter
      their political philosophy or affiliation. For transparency, I maintain
      a list of blocked accounts here. If you're not on this list, it means
      you haven't been blocked. :)
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't list spam bots here; there are too many. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Jo Victoria and Steve Jan: They were working as a team, liking each 
        other's posts and commenting at similar times. If they were just 
        candidates/supporters watching my page, I wouldn't have cared. But 
        this sock puppet double-act was wasting my time. 
      </li>
      <li>Patricia Matthews: She seems like a real person in the community. 
        But she refused to acknowledge information (like when she kept 
        insisting on me revealing who I am, despite being advised to look at
        my pinned post - and the front page of the Cranbourne News haha). 
        This is bad faith engagement. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Wayne Smith: NOT the former Casey councillor. Sock puppet for a 
        Gurpreet Gill supporter. Possible alt account for an ALP employee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Abhijeet Singh, Maddison Kormas, Kevin Weerakoody: Anonymous accounts,
        possibly run by supporters of Jaz Masuta. They appeared around the same
        time, posting long comments containing accusations against supporters 
        of Gurpreet Gill. Some of the claims are credible, but the <i>Casey
        Transparency</i> Facebook page isn't intended to be a battleground
        between rival teams.
