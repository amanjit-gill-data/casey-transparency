      Hello. This site exists because the Facebook page for <i>City of Casey 
      Transparency Advocate</i> doesn't allow file uploads.

    <h2>Accounts I've blocked</h2> 

    <i>Clarified: Tuesday Nov 5, 9:00 am</i>
    
    <p>
      I'm not in favour of blocking people who engage honestly, no matter
      their political philosophy or affiliation. All genuine commenters are 
      welcome on the page - even if I disagree with them - because I don't 
      want to contribute to alienation and disaffection. 

      That said, I've been compelled to block some accounts. For 
      <b>transparency</b>, I maintain a list of them here. Since the 
      behaviour that got them blocked was public, this list doesn't damage
      their public image any more than they have damaged it themselves.

      If you're not on this list, you haven't been blocked. :)
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't list spam bots here; there are too many. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Jo Victoria and Steve Jan: They were working as a team, liking each 
        other's posts and commenting at similar times, repeating claims I'd 
        already corrected, under different posts on my page. It was like 
        playing whack-a-mole. This sock puppet double-act was wasting my time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Patricia Matthews: She seems like a real person in the community. 
        But she refused to acknowledge information, like when she kept 
        insisting on me revealing who I am, despite being advised to look at
        my pinned post - and the front page of the Cranbourne News (haha...).
        She wasn't reading my responses - just replying with increasing
        anger, repeating the same themes. This is bad faith engagement. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Wayne Smith: NOT the former Casey councillor. Sock puppet for a 
        Gurpreet Gill supporter. Possible alt account for an ALP employee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Abhijeet Singh, Maddison Kormas, Kevin Weerakoody: Anonymous accounts,
        possibly run by supporters of Jaz Masuta. They appeared around the same
        time, posting long comments containing accusations against supporters 
        of Gurpreet Gill. Some of the claims are credible, but the <i>Casey
        Transparency</i> Facebook page isn't intended to be a battleground
        between rival teams.
      </li>
    </ul>
